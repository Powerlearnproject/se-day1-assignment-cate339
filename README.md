Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the art and science of designing, building and maintaining software solutions that solve real world problems.
-It is important because it creates solutions for global challenges hence promoting the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Birth of software development and programming languages - In the 1950s, the beginning of software development as a field, with programmers writing machine level instructions and dealing directly with hardware.
2. Software crisis and structured programming - In the 1960s, projects became complex and difficult to manage leading to emergence of structured programming emphasizing on modularity and clear code organisation.
3. Software engineering as a discipline - In the 1970s, software engineering was formalised to a discipline with development of methodologies and tools for software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Idea generation - This is where one comes up with an idea.
2. Requirement analysis - Gather what are the requirements needed.
3. Product design - Figure out how it will look and work.
4. Product development - Actualise your design through code.
5. Integration and testing - Check if the product matches the requirement and test if the system works.
6. Deployment - Roll it out for use to clients.
7. Maintenance - Better your software by improving the quality of software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. In agile methodologies, it breaks work into iterative steps which are smaller tasks that can be completed quickly while waterfall methodologies is a software development that follows linear sequence of events.
2. In agile methodologies, it focuses on modular systems designs and interfaces while in waterfall methodologies there's no specific approach to system designs.
3. In agile methodologies, testing is done incrementally while in waterfall methodologies testing is done all together.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Role of a software developer is to design, build, test and manage a software.
2. Role of quality assurance engineer is to ensure that the product meets quality standards before they are released.
3. Role of a project manager is planning, leading, communicating and managing risk and budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Intergrated Development Environments provide a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging and project management. It provides a unified interface for all stages of software development. Eg. Visual studio, Android studio.
-Version Control Systems enables collaboration and code version control. It allows multiple developers work on the same code base concurrently reducing conflicts and facilitating collaborations. Eg. Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Keeping up with rapid technological advancements - Software development is constantly changing with new languanges, frameworks and tools. It can be solved by trying out new tools and techniques to gain experience and also dedicating time to learn new technologies to stay updated in the industry.
2. Collaborations and communication - Working with diverse teams can be challenging requiring strong communication and collaboration skills. Strategies include communicating effectively using clear and concise language and paying attention to others' perspective and seeking clarification when needed.
3. Managing complex projects - Large complex projects can be difficult to manage. Strategies to overcome this is breaking down complex problems into smaller manageable modules to facilitate development and testing. Also utilizing project management methodologies and tools to organise task and manage resources.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - It's a software testing method  where you test the smallest functional unit of code. It ensures that each small part of the code functions as intended which helps catch errors early in the development process.
2. Integration testing - It is a type of software testing in which different units or modules of a software application are tested as a combined entity. It identifies defects or issues that arise when multiple software components are combined and interact.
3. System testing - Examines every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified system. It is used to identify defects and ensure the system behaves as intended
4. Acceptance testing - Is a quality assurance process that determines to what degree an application meets end users approval. It determines if a software system meets the needs and expectations of the end users before production

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting instructions to guide generative AI models towards generating desired, high quality outputs.
- It is important because it creates high quality responses or outputs from the AI models.
  
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Example of vague prompt "Tell me about climate change"
- Improved prompt "Tell me about cimate change in the western part of Africa"
- Improved prompts are more effective because they provide clearer and more specific instructions to the AI models leading to more accurate responses improving user experience.
